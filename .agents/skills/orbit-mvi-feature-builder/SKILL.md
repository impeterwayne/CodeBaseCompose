# SkillHub Orbit MVI Feature Workflow

## Overview

Implement or extend Android UI feature flows in the SkillHub codebase using the repository's canonical Orbit MVI pattern.

Use this skill when work involves any of the following:
- creating a new feature screen or flow
- scaffolding or modifying a type-safe route in `:core:navigation`
- creating or updating a `[Feature]Contract.kt`
- creating or updating a `[Feature]ViewModel.kt`
- creating or updating a stateless `[Feature]Screen.kt`
- extracting feature UI blocks into `components/`
- wiring a `[Feature]Graph.kt` with Orbit state and side-effects

Do not use this skill when the request is limited to:
- data, database, or network layer work with no feature UI changes
- build or environment setup only
- documentation-only work

**Primary reference:** `docs/feature_implementation.md`

**Canonical implementation anchor:** `:feature:pokedex`

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `references/guide.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory.
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.
- Treat `:feature:pokedex` as the gold-standard implementation unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise.
- Prefer repository-local conventions over generic Android or Orbit MVI examples.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Load Project Context

Inspect these sources before making structural decisions:
- `{project-root}/docs/feature_implementation.md`
- `{project-root}/docs/architecture.md`
- `{project-root}/docs/navigation.md`
- the target implementation in `:feature:pokedex`

### Step 2: Identify Scope

Resolve or ask for the minimum needed implementation scope:
- feature/module name
- screen or flow name
- route name and route arguments
- whether this is a root screen, detail screen, or multi-screen flow
- required use cases or domain dependencies
- whether cross-feature navigation is involved

If a required detail is missing and cannot be safely inferred from neighboring features, ask before implementing.

### Step 3: Find the Closest Existing Pattern

Inspect the nearest comparable feature module and `:feature:pokedex`. Use the closest valid local pattern first, then fall back to the pokedex.

### Step 4: Enter the Workflow

Execute the workflow stages below in order. Skip only stages that are genuinely out of scope for the request.

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Define or Update the Route

Work in `:core:navigation` and ensure route boundaries are type-safe and shared at the core layer.

**Must do:**
- Add or update the route in `Route.kt`.
- Use `@Serializable` and `@Parcelize`.
- Use `data object` for no-argument destinations.
- Use `data class` for destinations with arguments.
- Keep route definitions in the shared navigation layer so features do not depend on each other directly.

**Must not do:**
- Do not define feature-local route types outside `Route.kt` when the route belongs in shared navigation.
- Do not introduce string-based route handling when the repo uses typed routes.

**Success criteria:**
- Route type exists in `:core:navigation` and matches the needed screen flow.

### Stage 2: Define the MVI Contract

Create or update `[Feature]Contract.kt` in the feature presentation package.

**Must do:**
- Define immutable `UiState`.
- Define `Action` for user intent and lifecycle triggers.
- Define `SideEffect` for one-off events such as navigation, snackbars, dialogs, or transient UI instructions.
- Keep naming consistent with the feature and neighboring modules.

**Must not do:**
- Do not encode one-off navigation or transient effects as persistent screen state.
- Do not let the contract leak infrastructure concerns unrelated to presentation behavior.

**Success criteria:**
- The contract clearly separates state, intent, and one-off effects.

### Stage 3: Implement the ViewModel

Create or update `[Feature]ViewModel.kt` using the project-standard Orbit MVI structure.

**Must do:**
- Inherit from `BaseViewModel<UiState, SideEffect, Action>`.
- Inject dependencies with Hilt.
- Define the Orbit `container` with the initial state.
- Route incoming actions through `onAction`.
- Use `intent { ... }` blocks for mutations and side-effects.
- Use `reduce { state.copy(...) }` for state transitions.
- Use `postSideEffect(...)` for one-off events.
- Handle asynchronous work using repository-standard flow and result patterns.

**Must not do:**
- Do not mutate state outside Orbit intent/reduce flow.
- Do not push navigation decisions directly into stateless screen composables.
- Do not bypass the established result handling pattern used by neighboring features.

**Success criteria:**
- ViewModel owns feature behavior, state transitions, and one-off effects in the same style as `:feature:pokedex`.

### Stage 4: Implement the Stateless Screen

Create or update `[Feature]Screen.kt` as a pure rendering layer.

**Must do:**
- Accept a single state object and explicit callbacks.
- Render loading, success, and error states consistently with the repo's UI patterns.
- Use the project design system components and tokens.
- Keep the composable previewable where appropriate.

**Must not do:**
- Do not inject a Hilt ViewModel into the stateless screen.
- Do not pass navigation controllers into the stateless screen.
- Do not perform navigation directly from the rendering layer.
- Do not couple the screen to graph-level orchestration.

**Success criteria:**
- The screen is stateless, previewable, and driven entirely by inputs.

### Stage 5: Extract Feature Components

Use a `components/` package for nontrivial UI blocks.

**Must do:**
- Extract lists, cards, hero panels, and reusable UI blocks out of the main screen file.
- Reuse `AppPageFrame`, `AppPanel`, `AppText`, and other design-system primitives where applicable.
- Keep component APIs small and explicit.

**Must not do:**
- Do not leave large inline UI sections in the main screen when they reduce clarity.
- Do not substitute raw Compose primitives for project-specific design-system equivalents without a good reason.

**Success criteria:**
- The main screen remains readable and orchestration-free, and complex UI is isolated in components.

### Stage 6: Wire the Feature Graph

Create or update `[Feature]Graph.kt` as the navigation and orchestration boundary.

**Must do:**
- Hoist the ViewModel with `hiltViewModel()` at the graph boundary.
- Collect Orbit state with the project-standard compose integration.
- Collect side-effects and translate them into navigator actions.
- Map typed route entries with `entryProvider`.
- Render the active stack with `NavDisplay`.

**Must not do:**
- Do not move graph responsibilities into the stateless screen.
- Do not perform route mapping in unrelated files.
- Do not mix cross-feature orchestration into a feature unless the app-level wiring pattern explicitly requires it.

**Success criteria:**
- Graph owns routing, state collection, side-effects, and route mapping.

### Stage 7: Handle Cross-Feature Navigation Correctly

If the flow reaches screens in other feature modules, follow the repository navigation architecture.

**Must do:**
- Use app-level orchestration when feature modules must remain decoupled.
- Pass injected composable lambdas or callbacks from the `app` layer when required.
- Keep module boundaries clean.

**Must not do:**
- Do not create direct feature-to-feature dependencies that violate module boundaries.

**Success criteria:**
- Navigation remains type-safe and modular without circular dependencies.

### Stage 8: Validate Before Completion

Before considering the work complete, verify the implementation against the repo rules.

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Required module dependencies are present.
- [ ] Route exists in `Route.kt` and uses typed navigation conventions.
- [ ] Contract defines `UiState`, `Action`, and `SideEffect`.
- [ ] ViewModel uses Orbit `container`, `intent`, `reduce`, and `postSideEffect` correctly.
- [ ] Screen is stateless and contains no direct ViewModel or navigation leakage.
- [ ] Complex UI has been extracted into `components/` where appropriate.
- [ ] Design system primitives and tokens are used consistently.
- [ ] Graph owns ViewModel hoisting, state collection, side-effects, and route mapping.
- [ ] Cross-feature navigation, if present, respects app-level boundaries.

## Guardrails

- Always inspect `:feature:pokedex` before implementing a new feature flow.
- Prefer the closest local feature pattern when it is clearly valid and consistent with the architecture.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the requested flow.
- Preserve typed navigation, stateless rendering, and graph-level orchestration boundaries.
- Use repository patterns first; do not import generic patterns that conflict with local architecture.
- If the user request conflicts with core architecture rules, surface the conflict before implementation.

## Output

When using this skill successfully, the final outcome should include:
- the list of created or changed files
- the route, contract, ViewModel, screen, component, and graph decisions made
- the validation steps completed
- any unresolved assumptions, follow-ups, or required user decisions
